# dotzbot
it's a simple discordpy bot im making as a learning project, also cause i was insanely bored  
i'm not going to lie, i did use a bit of github copilot for this. but that's because i didnt know anything and i didnt feel like reading docs.  

TODO:  
Maybe:  
> Polls  
> Reminders  
> Channel Info  
> Translator (Just gonna need abuse checks and 100% a rate limiter)  
> Some sort of AI chatbot, works by pinging the bot and saying smth, like a question  
> Hangman  
> Text to speech with downloadable mp3. strong maybe as i'll need to learn so much more for this  
> slash commands  
> turn all commands into files, the main file is getting too big  
Most likely:  
> Prune  
> Punishment commands (Warn/Kick/Mute/Ban/Timeout) with permission checks  
> Trivia (need questions though)  
> Guess the number (probably the most complicated part of the bot in terms of code)  
> Leaderboards for minigames  
> Bot Info  
> Server List (that only i can see) with permission checks  
> Error handling cause i for some reason dont have that yet  
> Rate Limiting  
> 8ball  
> Shutdown message (just gotta learn how)  
> dotzbot status channel  
Denied:  
> Poker, Too complicated for me.  
> Code better, too hard
